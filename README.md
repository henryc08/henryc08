## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Henry, a grade 11 student at Merivale High School... and I love to build things! (engineering ftw ğŸ˜„)
I enjoy making embedded systems projects (i.e. Arduino), often having bits of web dev and AI. 
I also like to play badminton, soccer, go fishing, and do robotics (FRC)!

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about hackathons! I'm relatively new but I love to go to hackathons.
ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on an embedded systems project that tracks bruxism activity.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate complex machine learning into my projects!
